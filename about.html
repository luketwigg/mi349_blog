            <p class="content">My name is Luke Twigg. I am a senior and my major is Information Science with a minor in ICTD (information and communication technology development). One of my main hobbies is skateboarding, which is why I decided to make a blog about skateboarding. It has been a large part of my life for the better part of a decade and it probably always will be even when I canâ€™t physically do it myself anymore. I have made many friendships because of skateboarding and I have had many fun experiences because of the sport as well. I am excited to continue to share my experiences and opinions in relation to skateboarding here.<p>
